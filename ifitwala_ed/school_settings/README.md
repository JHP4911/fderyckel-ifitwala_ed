This modules is to set up

* __School Setup.__  A school can be made of several sub-entities.  For instance a school can have a secondary school, primary school and Kindergarten school.  Or a school can be made of several campuses.  Or it is a district with several schools in it. 
* __Department.__  Now each school can have several departments.  They are usually discipline related (the math dpt, or the English dpt., etc. )
* __Academic Year.__  
  * An academic year should have: a name, a start date and an end date. 
* __Academic Term.__  An academic term is always within an academic term.  Most schools have either 2 or 3 or 4 terms per year.  The terms should be the same for the whole school.  If they aren't, it maybe better to set up a different school.  
  * An academic term should be linked to an academic year, have a name, a start date and an end date. 
  * TIP: For courses that are year long, we suggest to create a year long term (and call it for instance S1-S2  for semester 1 + semester 2)
